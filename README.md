# hello-world
My introduction to the world of GitHub and the world's introduction to me.

My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.

No, no, that's not right.

Call me Ishmael.

No, that won't do, either.

Call me anything you want, but don't call me late for dinner, as I am obviously trapped in time back in the vaudeville era.
Computer geek by day, comedy SciFi writer by night, cheesy haiku poet in-between.
You can find me on Twitter as @HaikuHare where I do the classic American-style haiku, which contains three lines.
Commonly referred to as 5-7-5, the first and third lines contain 5 syllables and the middle line contains 7 syllables.
When I am not writing cheesy haiku or even cheesier SciFi Comedy, you can find me during non-vampire hours at a keyboard.
I started programming in January of 1981 on an HP3000 that our school accessed via dial-up modem using a rotary dial phone.
Since those auspicious days, I have graduated to the laudable position of Accounting Software Developer.
There is no accounting for taste, and no taste for accounting.
